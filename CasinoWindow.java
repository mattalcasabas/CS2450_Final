     * this creates and manages the Casino GUI

     *  - displaying main menu
     *  - displaying games list (blackjack, roulette, craps, etc?)
     *      - obviously we can add/remove games according to time
     * to keep things organized, each game should be on its own pane, and each pane should be its own file
     *  - e.g. Blackjack.java, Roulette.java, Craps.java, etc.
     *      - should we break up game logic and game GUI into different files?
